# RPGFriendFinder
Social Network I built from scratch (no libraries, no bootstrap, etc.) for RPG game enthusiasts. Site functions much like a standard dating website connecting 'Players' and 'Games'.
 
Features include profile/game creation, profile/game search functions, picture uploading, infinte scrolling, a live messenger, and email updates. All this was coded by hand, using no 3rd party code. No JQuery was used in the effort to minimize machine cycles for optimal user performance.

Entire project includes roughly 13500 lines of code.
